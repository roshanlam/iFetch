# iFetch

A robust Python utility for efficiently downloading files and folders from iCloud Drive, designed for bulk data recovery and migration. This tool helps users easily retrieve their data from iCloud Drive when Apple's native solutions are insufficient.

## Features

- üîê Secure authentication with 2FA/2SA support
- üìÅ Recursive directory downloading
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Resume-capable downloads
- üìä Progress tracking with detailed statistics
- üîç Directory listing functionality
- ‚ö° Efficient file handling with streaming downloads
- üîÑ Skip existing files to avoid duplicates

## Why This Tool?

While iCloud Drive provides excellent cloud storage integration, downloading large amounts of data or entire directories can be challenging through the standard interfaces. This tool addresses common scenarios such as:

- Recovering data after disabling iCloud Drive
- Migrating data between accounts
- Creating local backups
- Bulk downloading specific directories

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
python3 -m venv ivenv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```sh
pip install pyicloud tqdm keyring
```

3. Install system keyring dependencies:
For Ubuntu/Debian:

```

For macOS:

```

4. Configuration
Store your iCloud credentials securely:
```sh
icloud --username=your@email.com
```
The tool will prompt for your password and store it securely in your system's keyring.
